Introduction
------------

I read some stuff about meteor, trying to grasp the way it works. I was very pleased until I came aware that all that I did so far was unsafe, and I had to refactor the code and remove some packages to follow along. 

So I decide to write on the paper (well on an HTML marked up page), what I have to do in order to create, straight, a  - as it seems - good MeteorJS app.
